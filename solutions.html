          <p>The effects of cyberbullying can be devastating for the victims. They may experience various negative emotions, such as sadness, anger, frustration, and humiliation. They may also feel isolated and alone, as if they have no one to turn to. The victims may also suffer academically, as they may be too embarrassed to go to school or participate in class. In some cases, the victims may even consider suicide.</p>

            <h3>Make the most of privacy settings.</h3>
            <p>Investigate what measures you can take to keep content private on the websites you use. On Facebook and other social networking sites, you can adjust your settings so that only the people you select are able to see your personal information and posts. It’s important to check these privacy settings frequently, because sites sometimes change their policies.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="methods">
            <h3>Think before you post.</h3>
            <p>Never forget that the internet is public. What you put out there can never be erased. If you wouldn’t say something in a room full of strangers, don’t say it via internet. Even letting someone know sensitive or embarrassing information about you via email can have unforeseen consequences.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="methods">
            <h3>Keep personal information personal.</h3>
            <p>Don’t reveal identifying details about yourself—address, phone number, school, credit card number, etc.—online. Passwords exist for a reason; sharing them with friends is like passing out copies of your house key to friends and strangers alike. If anyone besides you knows your passwords, it should be your parents and your parents only.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="methods">
            <h3>Educate yourself.</h3>
            <p>Reading this article is a good starting point. Also check out other resources on the internet to get more information about how cyberbullying works and how to stop it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="methods">
            <h3>Educate others.</h3>
            <p>Does your school already have a policy against cyber-bullying? If you’re worried that your school administration isn’t doing enough to fight this problem, you could try speaking to school officials about your concerns and offering to help develop policies. If your school is already addressing the issue, see if you can help get the word out.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="methods">
            <h3>Speak out.</h3>
            <p>If your friends are cyberbullies, call them on it and explain to them how hurtful their actions are. If a friend is being cyberbullied, don’t stand by and do nothing. Talk to them about it and seek help from an adult. Your support may be just what the victim needs to overcome the problem.</p>
